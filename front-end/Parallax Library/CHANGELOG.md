## 5.0.0

Breaking changes:

* Parallax doesn't rely on create-react-context any longer, depends on React 16.3.2 (only affects Parallax)
* config, immediate and hold can now also accept functions. immediate will not accept an array any longer, if you want to set a individual property immediately without animating it, do this: `immediate={name => name === 'x'}`. config and hold can do the same, meaning you can give properties different settings.
* Transition bugfix (#67)
