### Springs and basic interpolation

You can interpolate almost everything, from numbers, colors, svg-paths, percentages, arrays to string patterns:

```jsx
<Spring to={{
    scale: toggle ? 1 : 2,
    start: toggle ? '#abc' : 'rgb(10,20,30)',
    end: toggle ? 'seagreen' : 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
    stop: toggle ? '0%' : '50%',
    rotate: toggle ? '0deg' : '45deg',
    path: toggle ? 'M20,380 L380,380 L380,380 Z' : 'M20,20 L20,380 L380,380 Z',
    vector: toggle ? [1,2,50,100] : [20,30,1,-100],
}}>
```

A couple of extra props you might be interested in are `onRest`, which fires once the animations stops, `onFrame`, which fires on every frame and gives you the animation value, `reset`, which literally resets the spring so that it goes through `from` to `to` again, `immediate` which can enforce values to spring to their to-values immediately (can be `true` for a zero-time spring or a function which receives the key names and returns `true` or `false` individually).

### Render props

Don't like the way render props wrap your code?

```jsx
const Header = ({ children, bold, ...styles }) => (
    <h1 style={styles}>
        {bold ? <b>{children}</b> : children}
    </h1>
)

<Spring render={Header} to={{ color: 'fuchsia' }} bold>
    hello there
</Spring>
```

Et voilÃ ! `Header` animates on prop changes! Props that `Spring` doesn't recognize will be spread over the receiving component, in this example `bold`, but it also includes `children` if you use `render` to refer to the render-child.

### Native rendering and interpolation ([Demo](https://codesandbox.io/embed/882njxpz29))

| <sub>Libraries animate by having React recalculate the component-tree on every frame. Here it attempts to animate a component consisting of ~300 sub-components, plowing through the frame budget and causing jank.</sub> | <sub>React-spring with the `native` property renders the component _only once_, from then on the animation will be applied directly to the dom in a requestAnimationFrame-loop, similar to how gsap and d3 do it.</sub> |

---

By default we'll render every frame (like in the image on the left) as it gives you more freedom (for instance this is the only way that you can animate React-component props). In situations where that becomes expensive use the `native` flag. The flag is available for all primitives (Spring, Transition & Trail, Keyframes, Parallax is native by design). **Try doing this in all situations where you can**, the benefits are worth it. Especially if your animated component consists of large subtrees, routes, etc.

Just be aware of the following conditions:

1.  `native` only animates styles and attributes
2.  The values you receive _are opaque objects, not regular values_
3.  Receiving elements must be `animated.[elementName]`, for instance `div` becomes `animated.div`
4.  If you need to interpolate styles use `interpolate`

```jsx
import { Spring, animated, interpolate } from 'react-spring'

<Spring native from={{ radius: 0, time: 0, x: 0, y: 0 }} to={{ radius: 10, time: 1, x: 10, y: 20 }}>
    {({ radius, time, x, y }) => (
        <animated.div
            style={{
                // Use plain animated values like always, ...
                borderRadius: radius,
                // For interpolations, call "interpolate" on the value itself, it accepts a function
                background: time.interpolate(t => 'rgba(0, 0, 0, ${t})'),
                // ... or supply a range clamp
                color: time.interpolate({ range: [0, 1], output: ['red', 'rgba(1, 50, 210, 0.5)'] }),
                // Or use generic interpolate, which takes multiple values, it accepts a function
                transform: interpolate([x, y], (x, y) => `translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`),
            }}>
        </animated.div>
    )}
</Spring>
```

##### More complex interpolations, chaining, clamping and ranges

In cases where you need to clamp or extrapolate, the `interpolate` function can take several properties that might be of interest to you. Specifically `range`, `output`, `filter`, `extrapolate`, `extrapolateLeft` and `extrapolateRight`. You can also chain results and interpolate further.

```jsx
<animated.div
  style={{
    transform: x
      .interpolate({
        // Map can route the input value through a custom filter
        // In this case we convert absolute values; helpful for delta-offsets for instance
        map: Math.abs,
        // Range and Output map input values to output values
        range: [50, 300],
        output: [0.5, 1],
        // Can be "extend" (default) or "clamp", clamp cut's off
        extrapolate: 'clamp',
      })
      .interpolate(x => `scale(${x})`), // interpolates the result of the above
  }}
/>
```

### Imperative Api

If it's necessary you can control your animations imperatively.

```jsx
import {
  AnimatedValue,
  animated,
  interpolate,
  controller as spring,
} from 'react-spring'

const App = ({ children }) => {
  const animation = new AnimatedValue('#28d79f')
  const hover = () => spring(animation, { to: '#c23369' }).start()
  const unhover = () => spring(animation, { to: '#28d79f' }).start()
  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{ background: animation }}
      onMouseOver={hover}
      onMouseOut={unhover}
    />
  )
}
```

### Transitions

Animates children as they mount and unmount. `from` denotes base styles, `enter` styles are applied when objects appear, `leave` styles are applied when objects disappear. Keys and children have to match in their order! The keys are the same that you would provide in any other looping situation.

```jsx
import { Transition } from 'react-spring'

<ul>
    <Transition
        keys={items.map(item => item.key)}
        from={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}
        enter={{ opacity: 1, height: 20 }}
        leave={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}>
        {items.map(item => styles => <li style={styles}>{item.text}</li>)}
    </Transition>
</ul>
```

For more complex animations you can return per-object styles individually. Let Transition know the actual data by passing it raw to `items`, either pass your keys like always or give it an accessor. And for more control, there's `update` which fires for nodes that are neither entering nor leaving.

```jsx
<Transition
  items={items}
  keys={item => item.key}
  from={item => ({ opacity: 0 })}
  enter={item => ({ opacity: 1 })}
  update={item => ({ opacity: 0.5 })}
  leave={item => ({ opacity: 0 })}>
  {items.map(item => styles => <li style={styles}>{item.text}</li>)}
</Transition>
```

You can use this prototype for two-state reveals, simply render a single child that you can switch out for another. You don't have to pass keys for this one.

```jsx
<Transition from={{ opacity: 0 }} enter={{ opacity: 1 }} leave={{ opacity: 0 }}>
  {toggle ? ComponentA : ComponentB}
</Transition>
```

If you need to track a single child, that is also possible:

```jsx
<Transition from={{ opacity: 0 }} enter={{ opacity: 1 }} leave={{ opacity: 0 }}>
  {toggle && Component}
</Transition>
```

**Important:** Since you do not provide keys in these two scenarios you **must** move you component out instead of creating it inside the render function. If you create your function instead of referring to it, then React will treat it as a new child, it will start unmounting/mounting even if your state remains the same. That will cause duplicated keys which will confuse both Transition and React.

### Trails/Staggered transitions

`Trail` animates the first child of the list you pass, the others will follow in a trailing motion. The api is similar to `Transition` though it will assume your list is fixed.

```jsx
import { Trail } from 'react-spring'

<Trail from={{ opacity: 0 }} to={{ opacity: 1 }} keys={items.map(item => item.key)}>
    {items.map(item => styles => <div style={styles}>{item.text}</div>)}
</Trail>
```

### Parallax and page transitions

`Parallax` creates a scroll container. Throw in any amount of layers and it will take care of moving them in accordance to their offsets and speeds.

`Parallax.pages` determines the total space of the inner content where each page takes 100% of the visible container. `ParallaxLayer.offset` determines where the layer will be at when scrolled to (0=start, 1=1st page, ...). `ParallaxLayer.speed` shifts the layer in accordance to its offset, values can be positive or negative.

```jsx
import { Parallax, ParallaxLayer } from 'react-spring'

<Parallax pages={3} scrolling={false} horizontal ref={ref => this.parallax = ref}>
    <ParallaxLayer offset={0} speed={0.5}>
        <span onClick={() => this.parallax.scrollTo(1)}>
            Layers can contain anything
        </span>
    </ParallaxLayer>
</Parallax>
```
